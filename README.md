# Create an AWS EKS Cluster with a Managed Node Group Using Custom Launch Templates

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS.

Through AWS EKS we can run Kubernetes without installing and operating a Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes.

AWS EKS helps to deliver highly available and secure clusters, and automates key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates.

Using a launch template, we will create an EKS cluster with the managed node group & custom AMI.
